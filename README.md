# Semantic Chunking and Evaluation Project

This project aims to facilitate learning about Semantic Chunking, a natural language processing task, and the evaluation of such tasks. Real judgment data from the Indian Supreme Court is used as an example dataset for demonstration and experimentation.

## Introduction

Semantic Chunking involves parsing text into meaningful units, such as noun phrases, verb phrases, or named entities. It plays a crucial role in various natural language processing applications, including information extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Example Data**: The project provides real judgment data from the Indian Supreme Court, offering a practical dataset for experimenting with Semantic Chunking.
- **Chunking Algorithms**: Implements various chunking algorithms for segmenting text into meaningful units.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of chunking algorithms, enabling users to compare different approaches.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools to help users understand the output of chunking algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to guide users through the installation, usage, and customization of the project.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/satish860/Semantic_Chunking_eval.git
   cd semantic-chunking-project
   ```


2. **Usage**:
   - Explore the example judgment data provided in the `judgment.pdf` .
   - Run the chunking algorithms on the data and evaluate their performance using provided scripts.
   - Visualize the results using the visualization tools included in the project.[Removed for now]

3. **Customization**:
   - Modify the chunking algorithms or evaluation metrics to suit your specific requirements.
   - Incorporate additional datasets for experimentation.
